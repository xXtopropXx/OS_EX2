FILES:
uthreads.cpp -- This file contains the implementation of the given file
		uthreads.h. it contains the implementation of a library
		which manage user level threads. a programmer can use this
		lib in order to run his code with several (user level) threads.

REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Q1:
	the advantages of several processes instead of several threads is: we
	can achieve better security, because the processes are more separated
	than the threads. If one process terminates for some reason the
	others will still be running. but the disadvantaged is that we can't
	share memory between processes.

Q2:
	c. The OS receives an external interrupts from the keyboard, when
		writing the kill command on the shell, when the user presses
		the enter key, the command is being executed as an internal
		interrupt, which sends a SIGTERM signal to the desired process.
		The process has a default handler to this signal, which closes
		the program, in a controlled manner. If this fails, a SIGKILL
		command is sent by the OS, then aggressively stops the process. 

Q3:
	real time is the  time as it exists in the “real” physical world, in
	such that using it corresponds to the "world's" time instead of the
	program starting time. “virtual time” is the sense of time inside an
	application. An example of real time is application which should
	display the current time. An example of virtual time is user level
	threads, or a application that makes a noise every 3 seconds.

Q4:
	a. i. Stack -- the child gets a copy of the parent's stack.
	b. pipe creates an interprocess communication channel,
	it allows to communication between process. it is needed in order
	to communicate between processes, and to transfer data between them.
